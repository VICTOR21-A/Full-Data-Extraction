# Full Data Extraction
# VICTOR KIPNGENO ROTICH388
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook for extracting, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets from multiple data sources. The notebook demonstrates a full data pipeline workflow — from raw data ingestion to processed and export-ready outputs.

## Project Overview
This notebook provides a **complete data extraction and processing pipeline** designed to help analysts automate data ingestion, transformation, and visualization. It supports multiple input formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, and web APIs.

Typical use cases include:
- Pulling data from web sources or APIs.
- Cleaning and transforming messy or inconsistent datasets.
- Generating reports, visualizations, or exportable files.
- Serving as a foundation for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.

---

## Features
- **Multi-source extraction**: Fetch data from local or online sources.
- **Data cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.
- **Data transformation**: Normalize, filter, and aggregate records.
- **Visualization**: Create plots and statistical summaries.
- **Export options**: Save processed data as CSV, JSON, or Excel.
- **Reusable template**: Modular cell organization for easy customization.

---

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have **Python 3.7+** and **Jupyter Notebook/Lab** installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VICTOR21-A/Full-Data-Extraction.git
cd Full-Data-Extraction
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
If a `requirements.txt` file exists:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Otherwise, install common dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl seaborn matplotlib
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `FullDataExtraction.ipynb` to begin.

---

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook.
2. Edit the configuration cells (file paths, API keys, etc.) if necessary.
3. Run the cells sequentially or section by section.
4. Review generated outputs (DataFrames, plots, or saved files).
5. Export the cleaned dataset using the provided cells.

Example command (inside notebook):
```python
# Example: Load CSV and clean data
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('raw_data.csv')
df.dropna(inplace=True)
df.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```

---

## Notebook Workflow
The notebook follows a structured, step-by-step workflow:

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Setup** | Import required libraries and define paths/configurations. |
| **2. Data Extraction** | Load datasets from APIs, CSVs, Excel, or HTML sources. |
| **3. Exploration** | Display previews, dimensions, and missing value summaries. |
| **4. Cleaning** | Handle NaNs, duplicates, and format inconsistencies. |
| **5. Transformation** | Apply filtering, aggregation, merging, and normalization. |
| **6. Visualization** | Generate statistical plots, histograms, or trends. |
| **7. Export** | Save final datasets as CSV/Excel or generate reports. |

---

## Data Sources
Supported input types:
- **Local files**: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`
- **Web data**: HTML pages, JSON APIs, online CSV links
- **APIs**: RESTful services returning structured data

Example:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
```

---

## Outputs
The notebook produces several types of outputs:
- Cleaned and processed datasets (e.g., `cleaned_data.csv`)
- Statistical summaries and charts
- Logs and metrics for validation

Example saved output:
```bash
outputs/
├── cleaned_data.csv
├── summary_stats.json
└── figures/
    ├── distribution_plot.png
    └── correlation_heatmap.png
```

---

## Extending the Notebook
You can customize the notebook for advanced workflows:
- Add new extraction sources (e.g., APIs or databases)
- Automate the pipeline with `papermill` or cron jobs
- Integrate with SQL/NoSQL databases
- Add validation layers (e.g., data quality checks)
- Convert to a Python script for production ETL pipelines

---

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Fix |
|--------|---------------|
| Missing packages | Run `pip install` for missing dependencies. |
| File not found | Check file paths and working directory. |
| API authentication errors | Ensure valid credentials or tokens. |
| Memory errors | Process data in chunks using `pandas.read_csv(..., chunksize=n)` |
| Notebook not launching | Reinstall Jupyter: `pip install notebook` |
